Love is always the best motivation to make people learning more and more. This is the reason why I named this website as SudyMatchs. By interacting, knowing and seeing other students may help you to find your love. 


In this project, I am responsible for editing personal information and displaying. Here is the page looks like.

The purpose of the design here is to allow students to post their basic information. I added zodiac sign here, because some students have research on zodiac sign, this information can give them a mysterious impression and allow each other to produce first fantasy. Let them further want to know each other. Also make this website more vivid and close to life

In this project, I learned more about the structure of the data, just like at the beginning I did not understand how to let users see other user information. Later I found the answer frome the file publication in the server folder.

Finally, in this learning process, let me know more about how a team plans and implements, and it will be more helpful in the future workplace.
