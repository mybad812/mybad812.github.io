Love is always the best motivation to make people learning more and more. This is the reason why I named this website as SudyMatchs. By interacting, knowing and seeing other students may help you to find your love. 


In this project, I am responsible for editing personal information and displaying. Here is the page looks like.

The purpose of the design here is to allow students to post their basic information. I added zodiac sign here, because some students have research on zodiac sign, this information can give them a mysterious impression and allow each other to produce first fantasy. Let them further want to know each other. Also make this website more vivid and close to life
