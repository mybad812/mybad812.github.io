  Hello everyone! Yes, you can call me Mybad. That's right Mybad! It is me. Here I am going to tell a story about why I got this nickname. In 2010, when I came to Hawaii alone, I met some Taiwanese friends. One day we came to play basketball, I can still remember the day was not my day. I kept missing shots, each time I missed a shot I said mybad, I choose not to memorize how many mybad I was saying in that day. One of my friend, his English was really poor during that time then he thought mybad should be my name. After that, he told everyone my name was mybad. Here we go, everyone calls me Mybad since that day.
  
	Now, I am going to make a short brief of my introduction. My name is Jui-Chen Tang, I was born and raised in Taiwan. I used to play online game a lot such as WOW, Diablo and Path of Exile. I really enjoy building a character in the game and pushing it to have a super strong player. But after I came to Hawaii, I start thinking to learn how to surf so surfing becomes my favorite sport in my life. Also I really love the air, beach and beer here. Currently I am UH student working on my second degree major in computer science ( focus on data science). My first degree was applied mathematics so after I graduate I noticed that I still need to build the ability of coding and processing data then I decided to seek more knowledge at UH. I believe I can integrate my math experience with computer science to become a useful person sharing my skill to contribute the world.
