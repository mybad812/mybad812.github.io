  This semester is my first experience encouter with javascript. Before this year I have learned java, C and C++. In fact, these language that I have known are strongly type which means that you have to declare a specific class to defind what you want to do such as string, int, double, and char etc.... However, in javascript it is very powerful so we don't have to defind their class to represent them. All we have to do is to assign the number, string, or char etc... Thus, I would say the javascript is a nice language for doing software engineering because it is very flexable and powerful so we can just foucus on the goal we wanted to achieve.
  
  During this week, I finally met the WODs which is a kind of athletic software engineering. The first time I was doing that is so weired, I have feel so stressful since I knew threre is a time limit and I feel so angry that I can't fininish it in the amount of time. In fact, the rage of not being able to do the WODs will increase my motivation learning more about javascript. So I am still getting used to it the feeling mixed with stress, rage, and motivation could be a very exciting experience.
