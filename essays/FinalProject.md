## University of Hawaii Carpool

Name: Hanna Park, Jui-Chen Tang,  Kayla Kwock

**Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)**
With Hawaii’s traffic being the second worst in the nation and limited parking space on UH campus, it can be very difficult to get onto campus via car. Sure there’s rideshare programs like Uber and Lyft, but for some it can feel unsafe; riding with strangers who you know nothing about. Not to mention the environmental impact caused by all the cars going to and from just for a single student, there must be a better solution to this. Of course there is : carpooling is a great solution to solve these problems. 
 
Our solution is a website which would allow users to organize carpools with other members of UH. Users can sign up to be a driver/rider, and drivers can search for riders that are most convenient to/from campus. These carpools can be recurring such as everyday classes or one-time such as for special events. 

**Mockup page ideas**
• User profile
• Driver profile
• Rating
• See who’s on your route
• Searching page for drivers (search by events, areas, )

**Use case ideas**
• Everyday classes
• On-campus events
• For some emergency case eg. students forget their book, note,.....

**Beyond the basics**
GPS for route
