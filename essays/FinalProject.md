Project Title: University of Hawaii Carpool
Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
Hawaii’s traffic is the second worst in the nation. The parking space at UH Manoa is limited and expensive. Carpool is a great solution to solve these problems. Many carpoolers feel unsafe when they ride with strangers. The UH carpool website requires UH IDs 
ers can feel secure Problems:
Traffic, Limited Parking 
High Fuel cost
Driver could have unstable schedule
Carpoolers feel unsafe when they ride with strangers
 
Our solution is a website which would allow users to organize carpools with other members of UH. Users can sign up to be a driver/rider, and drivers can search for riders that are most convenient to/from campus. These carpools can be recurring such as everyday classes or one-time such as for special events. 
Solutions:
Require UH emails to login and post
Setup a time list
A reward function to recruit your driver
Mockup page ideas
